# Dryad Informational Materials

The following guidelines are to help you use our logo and assets. When producing communications materials that carry the Dryad visual identity, please refer to these standards for usage.

## Using the Dryad brand and logo

Dryad's marks include, but are not limited to, the organization name, logo, social media skins and profile images, and any words, phrases, images, or other designation that identifies the source or origin with any of Dryad's creative work.

If you are another association or organization, do not modify or alter the marks or use them in a confusing way, or in a way that confuses Dryad with another brand.

If you are a Dryad Member organization, you have flexibility to associate your group with the organization as long as you have the approval of a staff member.

Please note that many of our brand assets are available as downloadable files below so that you can easily use them as needed.
